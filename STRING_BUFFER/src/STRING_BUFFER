Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string. The StringBuffer class in java is same as
String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.


Important Constructors of StringBuffer class
Constructor	                                Description
StringBuffer()	            creates an empty string buffer with the initial capacity of 16.
StringBuffer(String str)	creates a string buffer with the specified string.
StringBuffer(int capacity)	creates an empty string buffer with the specified capacity as length.



Important methods of StringBuffer class
Modifier and Type	                       Method                              	                        Description
public synchronized StringBuffer	append(String s)	                                is used to append the specified string with this string. The append() method is overloaded like append(char), append(boolean), append(int), append(float), append(double) etc.
public synchronized StringBuffer	insert(int offset, String s)	                    is used to insert the specified string with this string at the specified position. The insert() method is overloaded like insert(int, char), insert(int, boolean), insert(int, int), insert(int, float), insert(int, double) etc.
public synchronized StringBuffer	replace(int startIndex, int endIndex, String str)	is used to replace the string from specified startIndex and endIndex.
public synchronized StringBuffer	delete(int startIndex, int endIndex)	            is used to delete the string from specified startIndex and endIndex.
public synchronized StringBuffer	reverse()	                                        is used to reverse the string.
public int	                        capacity()	                                        is used to return the current capacity.
public void	                        ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)	                is used to ensure the capacity at least equal to the given minimum.
public char	                        charAt(int index)	                                is used to return the character at the specified position.
public int	                        length()	                                        is used to return the length of the string i.e. total number of characters.
public String	                    substring(int beginIndex)	                        is used to return the substring from the specified beginIndex.
public String	                    substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)	            is used to return the substring from the specified beginIndex and endIndex.




What is mutable string
A string that can be modified or changed is known as mutable string. StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used
for creating mutable string.


1) StringBuffer append() method
The append() method concatenates the given argument with this string.

2) StringBuffer insert() method
The insert() method inserts the given string with this string at the given position.

3) StringBuffer replace() method
The replace() method replaces the given string from the specified beginIndex and endIndex.

4) StringBuffer delete() method
The delete() method of StringBuffer class deletes the string from the specified beginIndex to endIndex.

5) StringBuffer reverse() method
The reverse() method of StringBuilder class reverses the current string.

6) StringBuffer capacity() method
The capacity() method of StringBuffer class returns the current capacity of the buffer. The default capacity of the
buffer is 16. If the number of character increases from its current capacity, it increases the capacity by
(oldcapacity*2)+2. For example if your current capacity is 16, it will be (16*2)+2=34.

7) StringBuffer ensureCapacity() method
The ensureCapacity() method of StringBuffer class ensures that the given capacity is the minimum to the current
 capacity. If it is greater than the current capacity, it increases the capacity by (oldcapacity*2)+2.
 For example if your current capacity is 16, it will be (16*2)+2=34.
