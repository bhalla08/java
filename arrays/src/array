Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array
are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store
only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored
on 1st index and so on.


Syntax to Declare an Array in Java

dataType[] arr; (or)
dataType []arr; (or)
dataType arr[];




Instantiation of an Array in Java

arrayRefVar=new datatype[size];



Syntax to Declare Multidimensional Array in Java

dataType[][] arrayRefVar; (or)
dataType [][]arrayRefVar; (or)
dataType arrayRefVar[][]; (or)
dataType []arrayRefVar[];

int[][] arr=new int[3][3];//3 row and 3 column




Syntax of arraycopy method

public static void arraycopy(
Object src, int srcPos,Object dest, int destPos, int length
)


Cloning an Array in Java
Since, Java array implements the Cloneable interface, we can create the clone of the Java array. If we create the
clone of a single-dimensional array, it creates the deep copy of the Java array. It means, it will copy the actual value. But, if we create the clone of a multidimensional array, it creates the shallow copy of the Java array which means it copies the references.
