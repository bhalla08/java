There are many differences between object and class. A list of differences between object and class are given below:

No.	Object	                                                            Class
1)	Object is an instance of a class.                           Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
2)	Object is a real world entity such                          Class is a group of similar objects.

4)	Object is created through new keyword mainly                Class is declared using class keyword
               e.g.                                                    e.g.class Student{}
    Student s1=new Student()


5)	Object is created many times as per requirement.	        Class is declared once.

6)	Object allocates memory when it is created.	                Class doesn't allocated memory when it is created.

7)	There are many ways to create object in java                There is only one way to define class in java using
    such as new keyword, newInstance() method, clone()          class keyword.
