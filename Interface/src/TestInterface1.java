//In this example, the Drawable interface has only one method. Its implementation is provided by Rectangle
// and Circle classes. In a real scenario, an interface is defined by someone else, but its implementation
// is provided by different implementation providers. Moreover,
// it is used by someone else. The implementation part is hidden by the user who uses the interface.
