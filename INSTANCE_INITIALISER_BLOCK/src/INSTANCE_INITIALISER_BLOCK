Instance Initializer block is used to initialize the instance data member. It run each time when object of the class
is created.


The initialization of the instance variable can be done directly but there can be performed extra operations while
initializing the instance variable in the instance initializer block.



Que) What is the use of instance initializer block while we can directly assign a value in instance data member? For example:

class Bike{
    int speed=100;
}



Why use instance initializer block?
Suppose I have to perform some operations while assigning value to instance data member e.g. a for loop to fill a complex
array or error handling etc.
