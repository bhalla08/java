Java ListIterator Interface
ListIterator Interface is used to traverse the element in a backward and forward direction.

ListIterator Interface declaration
public interface ListIterator<E> extends Iterator<E>


Methods of Java ListIterator Interface:

Method	                                                        Description
void add(E e)	                                        This method inserts the specified element into the list.
boolean hasNext()	                                    This method returns true if the list iterator has more elements while traversing the list in the forward direction.
E next()	                                            This method returns the next element in the list and advances the cursor position.
int nextIndex()	                                        This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to next()
boolean hasPrevious()	                                This method returns true if this list iterator has more elements while traversing the list in the reverse direction.
E previous()	                                        This method returns the previous element in the list and moves the cursor position backward.
E previousIndex()	                                    This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to previous().
void remove()	                                        This method removes the last element from the list that was returned by next() or previous() methods
void set(E e)	                                        This method replaces the last element returned by next() or previous() methods with the specified element.
