The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass
 or interface).

The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type.
It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.





When Subclass type refers to the object of Parent class, it is known as downcasting. If we perform it directly,
compiler gives Compilation error. If you perform it by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime.
But if we use instanceof operator, downcasting is possible.

Dog d=new Animal();//Compilation error
If we perform downcasting by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime.

Dog d=(Dog)new Animal();
//Compiles successfully but ClassCastException is thrown at runtime
