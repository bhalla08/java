Substring in Java
A part of string is called substring. In other words, substring is a subset of another string. In case of substring
startIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive.

Note: Index starts from 0.
You can get substring from the given string object by one of the two methods:

public String substring(int startIndex): This method returns new String object containing the substring of the given
string from specified startIndex (inclusive).

public String substring(int startIndex, int endIndex): This method returns new String object containing the substring
of the given string from specified startIndex to endIndex.
