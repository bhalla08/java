 //   We can create document api in java by the help of javadoc tool. In the java file, we must use the documentation
 //   comment /**... */ to post information for the class, method, constructor, fields etc.



//To create the document API, you need to use the javadoc tool followed by java file name.
//There is no need to compile the javafile.
